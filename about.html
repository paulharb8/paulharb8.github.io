        This page expands on a few areas I’m exploring in more depth. I like projects that help me learn by doing,
        especially if they involve telling a story with data or building something that others can use. When I work on
        web projects, I aim for clean structure, clear writing, and simple layouts that are easy to navigate. I try to
        write content that stands on its own, even for readers who are unfamiliar with the topic. For visuals, I focus
        on consistency in spacing, typography, and color, so the design supports the message instead of distracting from it. 
        So far I've bridged automation and data visualization by leveraging AI agents that can extract csv/ excel data and turn 
        it into corporate ready deliverables.
      </p>

        I also enjoy small experiments, like testing different chart types, learning how CSS layout works in different
        scenarios, or creating short guides for classmates. These experiments often lead to useful patterns I can reuse:
        navigation bars that are easy to scan, web layouts that work well on mobile, and color palettes that balance
        contrast and personality. Over time, I want to grow this site into a collection of small, polished examples
        that reflect what I’m learning and my professional identity. If you have feedback or just want to talk feel free, 
        to send a message via the contacts available!
