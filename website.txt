Styling & Customizations Description

My website was designed and styled using custom CSS, with several features that go beyond basic styling requirements.
Below are all the customizations implemented:

Custom Fonts and Typography

I imported and used Inter for body text and Playfair Display for headings through Google Fonts.
This combination creates a professional but modern tone that makes the text easy to read and visually distinct.

Custom Color Scheme
The site uses a dark background theme with cyan and purple accent colors.
Text and link colors were chosen for strong contrast and accessibility.
Subtle gradients and soft highlights were added to create visual depth.

Custom Layout and Spacing
Implemented a responsive grid layout for the home page hero section (image + text side-by-side).
Used consistent margins, padding, and rounded corners across cards and images to maintain a clean, balanced structure.

Navigation Bar Styling
Added a sticky, semi-transparent navigation bar that remains at the top while scrolling.
Includes hover effects that change background opacity for a smooth user experience.

Visual Effects & Shadows
Used box-shadows and blurred backgrounds on cards to give a “glass” effect.
Added gentle hover transitions for buttons and links.

Responsive Design
The layout automatically adjusts for smaller screens using CSS media queries.
Images and text stack vertically on mobile for readability.

Radial Gradient Backgrounds
Subtle radial gradient overlays add depth and visual polish to the background without distracting from the content.

Summary

Overall, the website reflects clean structure, modern design, and readability. The CSS customizations improve both aesthetics and usability, ensuring the site looks professional across devices while meeting all project requirements.
