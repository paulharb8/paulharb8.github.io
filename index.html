      <!-- ~220 words; feel free to personalize, just keep length ≥ 200 words -->
      <p>
        I’m a lifelong learner who enjoys building things, solving problems, and sharing what I learn with others.
        Lately, I’ve been interested in how design and technology come together to communicate information clearly.
        Whether I’m exploring data visualization, developing small web projects, or diving into new tools, I try to
        focus on building skills that help me explain complex ideas in simple ways. I appreciate visual design because
        it can make data easier to understand and more engaging to explore. I also like working on practical projects
        that produce something concrete, like dashboards, simple websites, and interactive charts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of schoolwork and projects, I enjoy playing soccer, spending time with friends, and cooking. I’m always on the lookout for ideas that connect different fields—bringing together creativity,
        automation, data, and communication. I think the best projects are the ones that combine clear goals, good
        organization, and thoughtful design. Over time, I want to keep building a portfolio that shows growth: cleaner
        code, better design choices, and a stronger sense of how to make information useful for real people. Thanks for
        visiting my site, I hope you find something here that sparks your curiosity!
